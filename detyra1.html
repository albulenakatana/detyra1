                <strong>Tiramisu</strong>(Italian: tiramisù [ˌtiramiˈsu], from tirami su, "pick me up" or "cheer me up")[1] is a coffee-flavoured Italian dessert. It is made of ladyfingers (savoiardi) dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of eggs, sugar, and mascarpone cheese, flavoured with cocoa. The recipe has been adapted into many varieties of cakes and other desserts.[2] Its origins are often disputed among Italian regions Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia.

                Tiramisu appears to have been invented in the 1960s, but where and when exactly is unclear.[3] The recipe for tiramisu is not found in cookbooks before the 1960s.[4][5][6] It is also not mentioned in encyclopedias and dictionaries of the 1970s,[7][8][9] making its first appearance in print in Italian in 1980,[10] and in English in 1982.[11] It is mentioned in a 1983 cookbook devoted to cooking of the Veneto,[12] and a Canadian tourist guide published in 1971.[13] This suggests that it is a recent invention.

             <h3>Ingredients</h3>
             <ul>
                <li>Ladyfingers</li>
                <li>Mascarpone</li>
                <li>Coffee</li>
                <li>Heavy Whipped cream</li>
                <li>Granulated Sugar</li>
                <li>Vanilla extract</li>
                <li>Cocoa powder</li>
             </ul>
             <p>Then I tried using a double boiler to gently cook the eggs and sugar before adding them to the mascarpone, which is a really common method used in lots of modern recipes (the Pioneer Woman has a great recipe!). I found it tricky to get the thick and creamy mascarpone layer I wanted.

                So, I ultimately decided to swap out the egg whites in favor of fresh whipped cream, because I like the flavor and texture more. The result is delicious and EASY! You’re going to love it!</p>
